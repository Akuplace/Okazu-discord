# Discord-bot

Made for practice and learning of Javascript. This project helped me dive and improve on subjects such as APIs and Databases.
This code is not to be copied as it is poorly optimized and much less readable.

Bot functions include an avatar/banner display, a purge command as well as twitter relays.
